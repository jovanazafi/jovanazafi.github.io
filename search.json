    "text": "Hi! I’m Jovana Zafirović, a sociologist with a strong passion for survey methodology, labor markets, and quantitative social science. Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade.\nI completed my PhD in Sociology at the University of Belgrade, supervised by Dr. Jelena Pešić. Before joining the ISS, I served as a Research Intern at Tilburg University, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Ruud Muffels. I hold a Master’s degree in Comparative Social Research from the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, which I completed in 2019.\nMy research interests span the sociology of work, social stratification, and political sociology, and I mostly explore these areas through computational social science methods, including multilevel models, structural equation models, and latent growth models.\nI am also deeply invested in survey research and methodology, with a particular focus on the development of longitudinal panel studies. Currently, I am co-leading a pioneering longitudinal study in Serbia alongside Dr. Bojan Todosijević.\nOn this website, you’ll find a brief list of my publications and works in progress. Additionally, you can explore detailed information on my research projects, learn about my professional and teaching activities, view my up-to-date CV (October 2024), and visit my Google Scholar profile.\nPlease feel free to contact me at: jovana.s.zafirovic@gmail.com"
